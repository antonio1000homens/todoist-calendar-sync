# Issue 307 — read-only Lambda invoker inventory

This is a source+deployment audit aid, NOT erasure recovery authorisation. It reads
all published Lambda versions, aliases and weighted targets, event-source
mappings in the selected region, resource invocation policies and Function URLs.
It does not call any AWS mutation or invoke providers.

## Run

node scripts/audit-erasure-lambda-invokers.mjs --prefix=todoist-calendar-sync --stage=production --region=eu-west-2 > lambda-inventory.json

The region here is only an example. Run for the actual region, each account,
stage and legacy prefix where these functions might have been deployed. Use an
audit-only AWS role with these read actions: lambda:ListFunctions,
lambda:ListVersionsByFunction, lambda:ListAliases,
lambda:ListEventSourceMappings, lambda:GetPolicy and
lambda:GetFunctionUrlConfig. No Lambda write role is needed.

The repository SAM template supplies the expected function names. The script
fails on incomplete pages or denied policy/URL reads. Missing expected functions
are explicitly reported. The process intentionally exits with status 2 even
after producing a full JSON inventory: read-only inventory is NEVER safety
approval. The output intentionally omits account ARNs, invocation policies,
queues and secret environment variables.

## Still mandatory before release

- Audit the actual deployed code for EVERY returned version and alias, including
  historic published versions that can be invoked directly.
- Audit identity-based IAM permissions, cross-account and direct invokers,
  schedules/EventBridge, Function URLs, legacy physical Lambda names and
  deployments in every region. Resource-based policy reads cannot prove these.
- Verify all provider, DynamoDB and ingress mutation paths, recurrence, webhook,
  DLQ, mapping and source/destination lease protocols against #307's checklist.
- Record reviewed redacted evidence and security signoff before marking the
  first acceptance box complete. An inventory alone is insufficient.
- Independently verify provider/Calendar identity aliases and strong provider
  absence before any future privileged recovery executor can be considered.

ERASURE_REPLAY_BARRIER_VERSION remains OFF. Do not run the offline atomic release
builder against production, restore suspended consumers, replay a DLQ, alter
fences or perform any destructive production test based on this report.
